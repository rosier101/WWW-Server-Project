      <p>Hello! My name is Rosalie Ramos. I am a computer science major in my senior year 
          in Kean Univeristy. This is my last semester and I will be graduating in May
          2021. Currently, I am interning as a front-end developer at a company called
          One National Conversation. Due to COVID, we are all currently working remote 
          as well. The languages I am most comfortable with are HTML, CSS, Javascript along
          with React.js framework. My short term goal is to find a full time job as a 
          front end developer or software engineer by the time I graduate. As for long term, 
          there are future projects I would love to complete when I have more free time.
          Outside of coding, I have been playing the violin for about 17 years, I love
          to playing videogames, painting and assemblying resin kits, and I am also a 
          big fan of the anime Sailor Moon.
      </p>

      <div class = "picborder"></div>

      <img class = "me2" src="IMG_1867.JPG" alt="Me">

      <p>I found that I am much more interested in front end development than I 
        am with backend, security, or database. All my life I have been a 
        creative person than I am technical. Front end allows me to keep embracing
        the creative side of myself. Even now I picked up a new favorite hobby where
        I paint and assemble figures of popular anime characters. Which is something
        similar to the image in my home page. It takes a lot of work such as priming,
        pinning, sanding, drilling, painting, putty, a lot of patience, and much more. 
        But the finished product is always worth it. Which is why I think I will stick 
        more with front end to allow me to things such as building the small webpage.
    </p>
